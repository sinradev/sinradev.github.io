Having test management integrated directly into issues means nothing falls through the cracks. We can track acceptance status in real-time and ensure quality from the start.</p><p>Sinra's real-time capacity planning has helped us avoid the overallocation issues that plagued our previous workflow.

- body: "<p>As a QA lead, I appreciate how Sinra treats testing as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. We can create test templates, assign them to our team, and track acceptance status without bouncing between tools.</p><p>The visibility into which specifications are ready for testing, which are in progress, and which are done means we can plan our testing cycles with precision. We've reduced testing delays by 40% since moving to Sinra.</p><p>The retrospective feature tied to each release has also helped us identify process improvements systematically. It's become our single source of truth for quality metrics.</p>"
