about:
  innovative_solution: The Next Generation of Project Management
  result_deep_reflexion: Sinra reimagines project management by combining dual workflows, real-time capacity planning, and integrated QA. Built to eliminate the trade-offs between structure and flexibility that plague traditional tools.
  problem_title: Why Traditional Project Management Falls Short
  problem_description: "Every project management tool forces a choice: follow a rigid workflow or live with chaos. Neither Agile alone nor Waterfall alone solves the real problems teams face. Sinra breaks this false choice."
  agile_pitfalls: Agile's Hidden Costs
  time_consuming: Meeting Overload Kills Productivity
  agile_environment: "Agile teams drown in meetings: sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily standups, retrospectives, and constant re-prioritization discussions. While collaboration matters, excessive synchronous communication wastes hours daily. Your team spends more time talking about work than doing it."
  meeting_overload: "60+ hours per month lost in planning meetings"
  constant_reprioritization: "Constant context-switching reduces productivity by 40%"
  efficiency_loss: "Team burnout from unsustainable pace"
  waterfall_pitfalls: Waterfall's Rigid Constraints
  loss_of_control: "Late Discoveries Derail Entire Projects"
  waterfall_methodology: "Waterfall delays problems until they're expensive to fix. Teams spend months building to incomplete specifications, then discover critical issues during testing. By then, rework is impossible without missing deadlines. Projects fail not because of bad execution, but because of structure that punishes learning."
  deadline_pressure: "60%+ of projects exceed timeline by 20% or more"
  rigid_schedule: "Changes require renegotiating the entire plan"
  quality_compromise: "QA becomes a bottleneck, not a safeguard"
  design_to: "The Sinra Approach: Structured Agility"
  sinra_combines: "Sinra introduces an entirely new way to work. Instead of choosing between structure and speed, get both through dual workflows that let specifications and development happen in parallel without friction."
  clear_planning: "Parallel Workflows (Spec + Dev)"
  clear_planning_desc: "Product teams write specifications while developers code. No waiting, no bottlenecks. Both streams feed into quality gates that actually prevent problems."
  global_vision: "Real-Time Capacity Intelligence"
  global_vision_desc: "See before you assign. Know exactly who's available, what they can handle, and when. Built-in capacity planning prevents overallocation and unsustainable sprints. No plugins, no spreadsheets."
  enhanced_control: "Integrated QA as First-Class Feature"
  enhanced_control_desc: "Testing isn't bolted on. Create test cases tied to specifications, assign testers, track acceptance status, and link results to development status. Quality built-in from the start, not added at the end."
  ready_to_transform: "Stop Choosing Between Chaos and Rigidity"
  ready_to_transform_desc: "Try Sinra risk-free. Teams report 40%+ reduction in planning overhead, predictable release dates, and higher code quality. All without the plugin sprawl of traditional tools."
