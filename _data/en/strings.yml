  innovative_solution: The Next Generation of Project Management
  result_deep_reflexion: Sinra is built from the ground up for modern software teams. Forget everything you know about traditional project management. This is a fundamentally different approach designed around how real teams actually work.
  problem_title: The Real Problems Teams Face
  problem_description: "Traditional tools create silos: planning here, execution there. Your real capacity remains invisible. Your quality depends on luck. Meetings multiply, but deadlines slip. Sinra breaks these silos. One single source of truth to plan, execute, and verify."
  agile_pitfalls: Inefficiency Through Fragmentation
  time_consuming: Scattered Communication Kills Momentum
  agile_environment: "Most teams use disconnected tools: one for planning, one for tracking, one for testing, one for communication. Your decisions get lost. Critical information lives scattered across emails and Slack instead of being centralized. Teams redo the same work over and over. Lots of activity, zero results."
  meeting_overload: "Teams waste 10+ hours weekly finding information scattered across tools"
  constant_reprioritization: "Teams spend 30% of time re-entering the same data in different systems"
  efficiency_loss: "Critical details get lost between disconnected tools"
  waterfall_pitfalls: Blindness Until It's Too Late
  loss_of_control: "Discovery Happens at the End"
  waterfall_methodology: "Traditional planning tools create a false sense of control. You don't see real capacity, actual progress, or test coverage until weeks into execution. By then, you're committed to dates that can't be met. Problems that could have been caught early become emergency fire drills. You don't fail because your team is bad—you fail because you can't see what's actually happening."
  deadline_pressure: "Most projects don't discover real issues until 60% complete"
  rigid_schedule: "When reality doesn't match the plan, teams improvise rather than adapt"
  quality_compromise: "Quality is treated as a negotiable trade-off, not a requirement"
  design_to: "The Sinra Approach: Visibility, Capacity, and Execution"
  sinra_combines: "Sinra is a single source of truth for your entire project. Everything teams need—planning, tracking, testing, communication, and deployment—lives in one place. Real-time visibility into capacity, progress, and quality. No context switching. No guessing. Just execution."
  clear_planning: "Complete Project Visibility"
  clear_planning_desc: "See your entire project in one place. Features, specifications, tests, capacity, progress, and communication all connected. Nothing falls through cracks. Everyone knows what's happening because it's all right there."
  global_vision: "Real-Time Capacity Intelligence"
  global_vision_desc: "Know exactly who can do what work, when. See overallocation before it becomes a crisis. Plan releases based on what teams can actually deliver, not wishful thinking. Capacity data that's always current."
  enhanced_control: "Quality Built-In from Day One"
  enhanced_control_desc: "Tests aren't an afterthought. They're part of the core workflow. Create test cases, assign testers, track acceptance status, all tied to development progress. Quality gates that actually catch issues before they become problems."
  release_mastery: "Master Your Release Cycles"
  release_mastery_desc: "Sinra treats releases as first-class entities, not afterthoughts. Every release has visibility into all features, test coverage, team assignments, and deployment readiness. No more guessing if you're ready to ship."
  release_planning: "Complete Release Planning"
  release_planning_desc: "See all features, capabilities, and issues that feed into each release. Track which teams own what, manage dependencies, and visualize the complete timeline from planning to production."
  deployment_readiness: "Deployment Readiness Checklists"
  deployment_readiness_desc: "Before any release ships, verify all acceptance criteria are met, all tests pass, and all teams are aligned. Go-live checklists ensure nothing is missed in the unpredictability of launch day."
  go_live_confidence: "Deploy with Confidence"
  go_live_confidence_desc: "With complete visibility into release status, team capacity, and test results, deployments become predictable events, not crisis management. Launch with confidence, not crossed fingers."
  release_team_coordination: "Coordinate Teams Across Releases"
  release_team_coordination_desc: "Visualize all teams involved in each release, track deployment timelines, and manage go-live checklists. Releases succeed through coordination, not firefighting."
  ready_to_transform: "Stop Choosing Between Unpredictability and Rigidity"
  ready_to_transform_desc: "Try Sinra risk-free. Teams report 40%+ reduction in planning overhead, predictable release dates, and higher code quality. All without the plugin sprawl of traditional tools."
