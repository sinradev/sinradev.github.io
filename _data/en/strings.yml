  time_consuming: The Time-Consuming Nature of Meetings and Adjustments
  agile_environment: "In an Agile environment, meetings pile up: sprint planning, reprioritization, endless discussions about which features to develop or not, and prioritizing bugs. While these exchanges are essential, they often lead to a significant loss of time, reducing the team's overall efficiency."

  waterfall_pitfalls: Waterfall Pitfalls
  loss_of_control: The Loss of Control in Development
  waterfall_methodology: "Conversely, the Waterfall methodology faces another challenge: deadlines. Projects frequently exceed their allotted time, and late adjustments are difficult to integrate into a rigid schedule. This leads to a loss of control over timelines and deliverables, often at the expense of quality or stakeholder satisfaction."
