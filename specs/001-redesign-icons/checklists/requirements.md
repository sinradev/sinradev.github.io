# Specification Quality Checklist: Icon Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Feature**: [Redesign Sinra Icons](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **All items passed** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Validation Summary**:
- 4 user stories clearly prioritized (P1: 2, P2: 2)
- 10 functional requirements defined with specific acceptance criteria
- 8 measurable success criteria with quantifiable targets
- 5 edge cases identified for consideration during design
- 3 design system requirement sections added to guide visual consistency
- Scope clearly bounded with out-of-scope items explicitly listed
- Assumptions documented for platform, timeline, and testing approach

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation planning artifacts.
