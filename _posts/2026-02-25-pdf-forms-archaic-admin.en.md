2026. We have generative AI. Autonomous vehicles are starting to drive. Voice interfaces understand nuance and context. Mobile applications do things we thought impossible five years ago.

And yet.

I receive an email from my insurance company. A PDF attachment. To file a claim. It clearly states: "Print, sign by hand, scan and send back to us".

The PDF format. Not modifiable. Not digitally fillable. Just a digital image of a piece of paper that doesn't even exist anymore.

I have to:
1. Print
2. Get a pen
3. Write my date of birth by hand
4. Find a scanner (or a phone to scan with)
5. Scan the sheet
6. Upload the resulting PDF

And on the other end? Someone has to receive this PDF, open it, read my handwriting, and manually retype the information into their computer system.

We're describing a complete circle of absolute inefficiency.

The worst part? **This is not an exception. This is the norm.**

## The empire of the archaic PDF form

Go search for:
- A tax return (even with modern systems, there are always PDFs to sign)
- A mortgage application
- A social welfare request
- An insurance claim
- A visa application
- An address change at the Post Office
- A university application
- A researcher data access request

**Everywhere. PDF forms demanding printing, manual signature, and scanning.**

It's become such an absurd cliché that we laugh about it. But it's a bitter laugh, from people who lose hours every year to a technological ritual that nobody asked for and everybody hates.

## Why? The real reasons

### 1. Signature: the false legal excuse

"But it's a legal issue! We need a real signature!"

Okay. Except that:

**a) Digital signatures exist**. Qualified electronic signatures (QES in Europe) have been legally valid for *years*. It's not experimental technology. It's recognized by law.

**b) But it requires infrastructure**. Certificates. Cryptography. Standards. It's complicated to implement. And it costs money.

So instead of:
- Investing in electronic signatures
- Training people to use them
- Updating systems

Organizations do: "Print, sign, and send back a PDF."

It's legally covered. It's simple for them. And it's hell for you.

**The printed-scanned signature is not more secure than an electronic signature. It's just more archaic.**

### 2. The technological heir: "If it works, don't fix it"

Many of these processes have existed for 15-20 years. Back then, PDF forms were *progressive*. They replaced postal mail.

"We had envelopes! Now we have emails! That's already huge progress!"

And it was true. At the time.

But it got frozen. Infrastructure was built around this PDF workflow. Changing it now? That means rearchitecting entire systems. Reevaluating processes. Testing. Training.

So instead: we leave it. We let people print and rescan. It's stable. It's predictable. It works.

It's also completely inefficient. But that's not the IT manager's problem who's retiring in 3 years.

### 3. The structural silo: the department that requests vs. the one that receives

Here's the real structural problem:

The organization you're sending the form to is divided. The people asking you for the form? They're not the same as those receiving it. And those receiving it aren't the same as those entering it into the computer system.

- **Department 1**: "Create a form for customers"
- **Department 2**: "Receives forms by email"
- **Department 3**: "Enters them into the database"

Each department has inertia. Each has a budget. Nobody is responsible for the entire process. So nobody has incentive to optimize it.

Instead:
- Department 1 uses a PDF template they've had since 2008
- Department 2 has an email inbox where PDFs arrive
- Department 3 has someone (or a team) manually typing each piece of information

It's terrible. It's also comforting because "it works" and nobody has to collaborate to change it.

### 4. Fear of change: "What if we lose data?"

"Yes, but if we change the system, we'll lose data."

No. That's an amplified version of a legitimate fear.

Yes, migrating processes is a risk. Yes, there's sensitive data. Yes, you need to be careful.

But that doesn't mean staying with print-and-scan forever.

It means: doing a real transition. Accepting the cost (yes, it costs). Accepting the investment. Creating a better solution. Then migrating gradually.

Except that requires leadership. Vision. Money. And many public and even private organizations don't have it.

So we continue with the frozen PDF. Forever.

### 5. Compliance: the real fake problem

"Yes but there are regulations! GDPR, NF3008, whatever..."

Okay. There are regulations. Serious ones. Important ones. Financial data, health data—that requires rigor.

But you know what? Well-built modern digital forms are **more compliant** than handwritten PDFs.

Why?
- Complete trace (who signed when, with what IP address)
- End-to-end encryption possible
- Automatic audit trails
- Impossible to lose a document
- No approximate photocopy

Print-scan-retype-by-hand PDFs? It's a compliance nightmare. You have manual retranscriptions (sources of error), no real authentication trace, and zero audit trail.

So the real compliance problem is exactly *using* PDFs. Not the opposite.

## The catastrophic user experience

But beyond systemic reasons, there's something more cynical.

**Organizations don't change because this problem doesn't touch them.**

*You* have to print. *You* have to scan. *You* consume unnecessary paper. *You* lose time.

The organization? It saves on digital infrastructure. It uses a system its employees know. It minimizes perceived risk.

It's a classic asymmetry. The cost falls on the user/client. The benefit stays with the organization.

And nobody is motivated enough to change.

## The hidden reasons (the real ones)

Alright, let's be honest:

**1. Technical debt is invisible.** If the system technically works (even if it's archaic), managers think there's no problem.

**2. Decision-makers don't use the processes they create.** The CEO never prints their own form. So they don't see the problem.

**3. The cost of change *seems* enormous**, while the cost of the status quo is diluted and invisible.

**4. Bureaucratic organizations resist change by nature.** It's a feature, not a bug, for them.

**5. Nobody loses performance points using manual PDFs.** People continue, complain, but submit. There's no crisis forcing change.

## What it actually costs

Let's try to quantify:

A form taking 15 minutes to fill out (printing, writing, scanning) x 10,000 users per year = 2,500 hours per year.

At €50/hour of lost productivity = €125,000.

And on the receiving end? Someone typing this data manually? It takes time. It introduces errors. It requires correction.

For an insurance company, a social service, an administration? That's hundreds of thousands of euros per year. Just in inefficiency.

But it's diluted. Not visible. So it continues.

## The real question: what do we do?

Here's what a sensible organization would do:

**1. Accept it's a real problem.** Not a small complaint. A systemic problem.

**2. Invest in modern infrastructure**:
- Truly fillable digital forms
- Qualified electronic signatures
- Mobile-first interfaces
- Secure storage
- Automated processing

**3. Progressive migration**: Not all at once. Phase by phase. With the old system running in parallel for a while.

**4. Involve the users**: Ask *really* what they need. Not just "what can we do with our current tech".

**5. Measure success**: Less processing time. Fewer errors. Fewer follow-ups. Better customer satisfaction.

But it requires will. Vision. Humility to accept that the system you built is bad.

And here we return to our recurring themes: **trust and responsibility**.

Organizations saying "print and rescan" are the same ones who don't trust their employees. Same mentality: "I won't trust you with this. I'll force you to do a terrible process that's easier for me to control."

Instead of: "Here's what we need. How do we do this together, intelligently and efficiently?"

## Toward a better vision

An approach centered on humanity and trust would do it differently.

You'd think first of *your user*. Not the system. Not the infrastructure. The **person who has to fill out this form**.

What would they need?
- To fill it from their phone
- To save and come back later
- To understand what you're asking and why
- To receive immediate confirmation
- To not go crazy with archaic processes

Then you'd build the system around that. Not the other way around.

That's what Sinra and a slow tech approach promise: processes designed by and for humans. Not systems designed by and for bureaucracy.
